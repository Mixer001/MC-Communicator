### How to use?
This mod is for the **1.20.4** version of Minecraft **Fabric server**. No client side mods are required.

Add the jar to the server's mods folder and start the server. Now a config file should be generated (otherwise check server logs for possible errors).
In the config file for MC Communicator set `webhook.URL` to the URL of a webhook on your Discord server. Leave no space between the `=` sign and URL.
